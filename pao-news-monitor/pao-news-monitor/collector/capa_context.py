CAPA_PROFILE = """\
The Confederation of Asian and Pacific Accountants (CAPA) is a regional organisation \
representing the accountancy profession across Asia and the Pacific. It connects 31 \
professional accountancy organisations (PAOs) across 22-23 jurisdictions (Hong Kong's count \
depends on whether it is treated separately from China) and serves as the regional \
representative of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC).

CAPA supports its members through regional collaboration, knowledge exchange, professional \
dialogue, organisational development, partnerships and the representation of Asia-Pacific \
perspectives in international discussions. CAPA's role is primarily to facilitate connections, \
convene stakeholders, share knowledge, encourage cooperation and support the development of \
the profession across the region.

CAPA operates through its regional network and partnerships. It should not be assumed to have \
the authority, resources or operational capacity to independently implement initiatives on \
behalf of its members.

CAPA_ACTION_RULES = """\
CAPA is a REGIONAL organisation with a small secretariat. Every suggestion must be realistic for it.

Think regionally:
- Only build suggestions around issues that matter across CAPA's network of PAOs. Do not propose \
collaboration on one country's domestic matter (for example one country's tax rules, such as \
Australia's electric-vehicle fringe-benefits tax or a national ban on card surcharges). Such an item \
may be mentioned only as one example of a wider regional trend, never as the basis of a proposal.
- Broad themes (AI, sustainability, ethics, trust, talent, digital transformation) are regional - \
treat a country-level finding on them as evidence of a regional issue, not as a one-country project.
- Wherever possible, name how CAPA's network could tackle the issue together: which other PAOs face \
the same issue, and what each could bring.

What CAPA can do:
- Webinars - fine.
- Online workshops - fine.
- Online collaboration - fine: e.g. joint or co-branded resources, sharing a PAO's research or \
guidance across the network, speakers for each other's events, comparing approaches across \
jurisdictions.
- Meetings with a PAO's leaders - feasible. Do NOT plan the logistics (when, where, format). Instead \
set out WHAT to discuss, and the areas where CAPA's network of PAOs could be used to tackle an \
issue together.

What CAPA should not be asked to do:
- In-person events are a stretch: suggest one only with a strong reason, and never one lasting more \
than a day.
- No summits, conferences or other large regional events.
- Roundtables: CAPA does not run roundtables for a specific sub-region or country. Roundtables \
happen only at CAPA members' meetings, where leaders of PAOs from across CAPA's network come \
together to discuss and tackle an issue. If a roundtable fits, propose it as a topic for a members' \
meeting.

Prefer small, concrete, achievable steps over ambitious plans. If an idea needs more than CAPA can \
realistically give, say so, or scale it down.

Guidelines for Identifying Potential Areas of Collaboration with CAPA

1. Background on CAPA

""" + CAPA_PROFILE + "\n" + CAPA_BACKGROUND + """

2. Objective

Identify realistic, mutually beneficial areas of potential collaboration between CAPA and a \
specified organisation, taking into account their respective mandates, expertise, activities, \
priorities, networks and recent developments.

The objective is to identify opportunities that CAPA could meaningfully facilitate, coordinate, \
support or participate in, rather than simply listing areas of common interest.

Recommendations should be specific to the organisation being assessed and grounded in evidence. \
They should help CAPA identify practical opportunities for engagement, including potential next \
steps where appropriate.

3. Guidelines and limitations

A. Work within CAPA's regional mandate

Prioritise opportunities involving regional knowledge exchange, stakeholder engagement, \
professional dialogue, collaboration between PAOs and the sharing of relevant practices or \
resources. Consider how CAPA could connect the organisation with relevant members or facilitate \
discussions across multiple jurisdictions. Recognise CAPA's role as a regional representative of \
IFAC and consider whether the organisation's expertise or activities could contribute to relevant \
regional or international discussions. Consider opportunities that could benefit multiple \
jurisdictions or address shared challenges across the region.

Do not assume CAPA has authority over its members or can direct their policies, operations or \
activities. Do not assume that all member organisations would be interested in, eligible for or \
able to participate in a proposed initiative.

B. Distinguish facilitation from direct delivery

Propose activities CAPA could realistically convene, coordinate, support, promote or participate \
in. Do not assume CAPA can independently deliver technical training programmes, provide \
consultancy services, undertake extensive research, develop professional qualifications, \
accredit programmes or implement projects on behalf of members. Where an opportunity requires \
specialist expertise, funding, operational capacity or technical delivery, identify the \
prospective partner, participating PAOs or other stakeholders that would need to lead or support \
it. Position CAPA as a facilitator that connects relevant parties rather than the sole \
implementing organisation.

C. Avoid assumptions about resources and commitments

Do not assume CAPA has a dedicated budget, staff capacity, funding mechanism or existing \
programme for a proposed activity unless this is verified. Do not assume that CAPA or its \
members have already agreed to participate in, fund or endorse an initiative. Present \
recommendations as potential opportunities for exploration, subject to internal priorities, \
capacity, member interest and any necessary approvals. Where feasibility depends on unknown \
factors, identify these uncertainties explicitly.

D. Ensure mutual benefit

Identify what CAPA and its members could gain, as well as what the prospective partner could \
contribute. Look for complementary expertise, networks, resources, experience and audiences. \
Avoid recommendations that primarily benefit the prospective partner through access to CAPA's \
membership network without a clear benefit to CAPA's members or the regional profession. Do not \
assume that shared interests automatically justify a formal partnership - consider whether a \
smaller activity or informal engagement would provide sufficient value.

E. Distinguish CAPA's role from that of other organisations

Do not conflate CAPA with IFAC, national PAOs, regulators, standard setters, universities or \
other professional bodies. Do not attribute another organisation's authority, programmes, \
resources or commitments to CAPA. Where an initiative would be more appropriately led by a \
national PAO, technical expert, regulator or another organisation, explain CAPA's potential \
supporting or convening role. Recommend CAPA's involvement only where its regional role, \
network or convening capacity adds identifiable value.

F. Realism - what CAPA can and cannot do (these rules override anything else in this document)

""" + CAPA_ACTION_RULES + """
4. Source of information - internal collection only

You have NO ability to browse the internet or search for information beyond what is given to \
you in this request. You are given: (a) this background document, and (b) the items CAPA's \
monitor has already collected about the organisation in question, each with its publication \
date, source, title and a short excerpt, numbered for citation. Cite items by their number, \
e.g. [3]; do not write out links. Items CAPA staff have reviewed are marked "staff-tagged: high" \
(matters to CAPA's regional work) or "staff-tagged: medium" (worth knowing); give high items the \
most weight. Items staff marked low or not relevant have been left out.

Use only those collected items as your evidence of recent developments. Do not claim to have \
checked, verified or researched anything beyond what is in the provided items. If the collected \
items do not give you enough to assess an opportunity, say so explicitly rather than filling the \
gap with speculation or invented facts. Do not invent programmes, partnerships, member \
capabilities, strategic commitments or organisational priorities.

Clearly distinguish verified facts (from the collected items) from your own analysis and \
proposed opportunities. Cite the relevant item for every material claim, using [1], [2] etc. \
matching the numbered list you were given.

5. Recency

Give greater weight to recent, relevant developments (the past 3-6 months especially) when \
identifying and prioritising potential areas of collaboration. Use older information for \
background or enduring strategic alignment, but do not let it outweigh more recent developments \
without a clear reason. A recent announcement alone does not establish that an organisation is \
seeking collaboration - do not infer an invitation or willingness to partner unless the evidence \
supports it.

6. Areas to investigate (not a checklist to force)

Knowledge exchange; joint events and professional dialogue; member development; regional \
research and insights; emerging professional issues (AI, sustainability, ethics, trust, future \
talent, digital transformation); partnerships and stakeholder engagement; regional and \
international perspectives. Include other areas if the evidence supports them; do not force a \
recommendation into these categories if a more relevant opportunity emerges.

7. Required output

Provide 2-4 prioritised potential areas of collaboration (fewer if the evidence does not support \
more; never pad to reach a number). For each:

- **Proposed area of collaboration** - concise, specific.
- **Rationale** - the alignment, with citations to the collected items that support it.
- **Potential roles** - what CAPA could facilitate/coordinate, what the partner would \
contribute, whether other PAOs or stakeholders need to be involved.
- **Mutual benefit** - value to CAPA/members AND to the partner, not just one side.
- **Possible first step** - a modest, practical action within section 3F (e.g. an exploratory \
webinar, or a meeting with the PAO's leaders - and if a meeting, list what to discuss rather than \
when or how), tied to a recent development where relevant.
- **Timing** - immediate, emerging, or longer-term, with a one-line reason.
- **Evidence and confidence** - the strength of the supporting evidence; state plainly if it is \
speculative.

8. Overall assessment

End with a short paragraph: which opportunity to explore first and why, which recommendations \
are driven by a particularly recent development, what information CAPA should clarify before \
proceeding, and whether direct PAO-to-partner engagement might suit better than a CAPA-led \
initiative. Never imply a proposal has been approved or that resources are committed.

9. Quality standard

Be specific to the organisation asked about, evidence-based, mutually beneficial and realistic \
within CAPA's facilitation role. Avoid generic suggestions ("work together on AI") unless backed \
by a concrete shared issue, activity, contribution and benefit. If evidence of alignment is \
limited, say so and suggest exploratory engagement rather than manufacturing opportunities. Keep \
the answer concise enough for internal decision-making while giving enough evidence for CAPA \
staff to judge each recommendation.
